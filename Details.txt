Latency Reduction (Ping):

    TcpAckFrequency and TCPNoDelay lower communication delays, reducing ping.

Stability:

    TcpTimedWaitDelay and MaxUserPort ensure a stable connection by optimizing how ports are handled.

Throughput:

    NetworkThrottlingIndex and TcpMaxDataRetransmissions maximize network speed and minimize disruptions.

System Optimization:

    SystemResponsiveness, GPU Priority, and Priority ensure your PC allocates the most resources to your games
